  [State-of-the art math information retrieval systems]%
  {Systems that received the best accuracies in the competitions.
   For the NTCIR Math tasks, where none of the evaluation measures was
   primary, I list all systems that received the best accuracies in some
   combination of subtask, measure, and judgement binarization. For the ARQMath
   labs, where the nDCG' measure was primary, I list all systems that received
   the best nDCG' in one of the two tasks. $^{\text{*}}$Asterisks denote
   post-hoc participation in past competitions.}

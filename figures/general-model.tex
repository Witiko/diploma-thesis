  [Training objective of the general language model]%
  {For every token in the sentence ``The quick brown fox jumps over
   the lazy dog'', the general model moves the input vectors of
   its context tokens (blue) and its output vector (solid yellow),
   so that the context vector (dashed yellow) is closer to
   its output vector in terms of the scoring function.}

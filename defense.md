Good afternoon,

my name is Vít Novotný and this is the defense of my doctoral thesis.
First, I will summarize the key points of my thesis.
Then, I will react to the reader's reports and answer any follow-up questions from the audience.

# Introduction {#introduction}

When Ptolemy the 1st Soter, the Ancient Macedonian general of Alexander the
Great, found Euclid's seminal work, *the Elements*, too difficult to study,
he asked the matematician, whether there was an easier way to master geometry.
According to historical accounts, Euclid famously responded: \`\`Sire, there
is no royal road to mathematics.''

Two centuries later, David Hilbert has successfully axiomatized the Euclidean
geometry, but *the Elements* are arguably as current and as relevant as they
were when Euclid first wrote them.  This is because in mathematics, the new
does not invalidate the old and mathematicians rely on their discipline's rich
published heritage. However, since the advent of the world wide web, math
literature has more than doubled in volume, which makes it increasingly
difficult to find mathematical results without specialized math-aware search
engines.

Thankfully, such search engines do exist and are actively deployed in digital
mathematical libraries. First, optical character recognition is used to extract
both text and mathematical formulae from scanned documents. Then, specialized
math representations are used to enable fast and accurate retrieval using
advanced mathematical queries. However, user studies have shown that as much as
95\% of queries in digital mathematical libraries are simple text queries that
do not make proper use of the search engines. This indicates that the users
struggle to understand why the advanced mathematical queries produced the
results that they did.

- Mathematicians dream of a digital library of all peer-reviewed math literature. [@sojka2010towardsb]
- Math literature is scarcely digitized and doubles in volume every 16 years. [@trott2016overview] [@bouche2008some]

- Math information retrieval systems retrieve math literature from digital libraries.
- OCR techniques and math representations ensure fast and accurate retrieval.
- 95\% of queries are stated in simple text, [@libbrecht2006methods] [@miller2013three] which exposes interpretability gaps.

> \`\`We find math search to be used modestly, but this is not surprising given
> that users don’t expect it and we have ruled out being confrontational to
> promote it.'' @miller2013three

## Research Questions {#research-questions}

* * *

- I focus on representations and techniques that make retrieval results interpretable:
    - *Token embeddings* explain semantic relationships between text and math symbols.
    - *Voting algorithms* combine systems to improve accuracy without loss of interpretability.

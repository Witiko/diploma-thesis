# Introduction {#introduction}

- Mathematicians dream of a digital library of all peer-reviewed math literature. [@sojka2010towardsb]
- Math literature is scarcely digitized and doubles in volume every 16 years. [@trott2016overview] [@bouche2008some]

- Math information retrieval systems retrieve math literature from digital libraries.
- OCR techniques and math representations ensure fast and accurate retrieval.
- 95\% of queries are stated in simple text, [@libbrecht2006methods] [@miller2013three] which exposes interpretability gaps.

## Research Questions {#research-questions}

foo

- I focus on representations and techniques that make retrieval results interpretable:
    - *Token embeddings* explain semantic relationships between text and math symbols.
    - *Voting algorithms* combine systems to improve accuracy without loss of interpretability.

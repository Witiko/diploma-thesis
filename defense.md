# Introduction {#introduction}

- Mathematicians dream of a digital library of all peer-reviewed math literature. [@sojka2010towardsb]
- Math literature is scarcely digitized and doubles in volume every 16 years. [@trott2016overview] [@bouche2008some]

> \`\`The amount of resources available to digitize mathematics is
> significantly less than the resources available to digitize cats.'' ---@watt2016semantic

- Math information retrieval systems retrieve math literature from digital libraries.
- OCR techniques and math representations ensure fast and accurate retrieval.
- 95\% of queries are stated in simple text, [@libbrecht2006methods] [@miller2013three] which exposes usability gaps.

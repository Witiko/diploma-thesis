# Introduction {#introduction}

- Mathematicians dream of a digital library of all peer-reviewed math literature. [@sojka2010towardsb]
- Math literature is scarcely digitized and doubles in volume every 16 years. [@trott2016overview] [@bouche2008some]

- Math information retrieval (MIR) emerged in 2012 to retrieve math documents from digital libraries.
- 95\% of queries in MIR systems are simple text queries, [@libbrecht2006methods] [@miller2013three] which exposes usability gaps.
